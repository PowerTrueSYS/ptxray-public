# egress-lint.sh -- the product no-assessment-network static grep-class lint.
# Explicitly demoted to "a cheap, fast, PR-time tripwire" -- NOT the enforcement
# mechanism. The syscall-trace CI in egress-trace.sh (and a real AIX truss lab
# run) is the real enforcement mechanism (b).
# A grep is "readily bypassed by shell variables, other clients, Python/Perl
# sockets, or direct socket code" (§3.3's own words) -- this catches the common
# case immediately, nothing more.
#
# Usage:
#   egress-lint.sh <file> [<file> ...]
#
# General command-name tokens are matched as whole WORDS (\b...\b), while the
# shell device paths are matched as literal path prefixes. An earlier draft
# matched bare substrings and false-positived on tftp_value (contains "ftp"),
# "curlabel" (a real awk variable name in this repo containing "curl"), and
# "sync " (contains "nc "); caught live against this repo's own aixray-aix.sh
# during this milestone's self-review, not deferred -- see CHANGELOG.
#
# DNS lookup clients need a narrower grammar because `host` is also ordinary
# prose and `$HOST` is a scanner variable. A second pass tokenizes each shell
# source line (comments and quoted prose stay non-command arguments) and rejects
# host/nslookup/dig only when used as a command, including the scanner's
# `aix <fixture-key> <command> ...` capture wrapper. This is still deliberately
# a grep-class tripwire, not a substitute for the real AIX syscall trace.
#
# A violation is allow-listed two ways (never a blanket file-level exemption):
#   1. Same-line marker: the matching line itself carries
#      `# network-lint: allow -- <reason>`.
#   2. Block marker: a line `# network-lint: allow-next=<N> -- <reason>` (on
#      its own) allow-lists the NEXT <N> physical lines -- for data tables
#      (e.g. a here-string of STIG service names) where appending a trailing
#      comment to each data line would corrupt the data itself.
